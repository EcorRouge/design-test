# design-test
A simple HTML certificate template for showcasing design skills.

This certificate will be rendered to a PDF and a lot of users will print it.

The app logo can be found at https://test.reveles.ai/

The template needs to remain a single file, so all CSS needs to be included in the HTML file.  No Javascript should be used since it will not execute while rendering to PDF.

Please send your completed version of the file to Jay via an Upwork Message when you are done.
